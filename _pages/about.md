I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). My research interests lie in Embodied AI, with a specific focus on Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). I am currently exploring topics in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

Beyond research, I am a passionate photographer. I enjoy scouting for the perfect photo spots on RedNote across different cities, capturing both scenic landscapes and portraits.

I am eager to make friends from all around the world. If you are looking for a friend from Hangzhou, China to exchange ideas with—whether about academic research, daily life, or cultural topics—please feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:zhuyuze23@mails.ucas.ac.cn). I welcome emails from everyone!

While this page is just a starting point, I aim to continuously enrich it as I grow. I look forward to participating in more open-source projects and making meaningful contributions to the field in the future. testtest
