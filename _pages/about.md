I am a third-year undergraduate student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). My research interests include Embodied AI and Vision-Language Navigation (VLN).

I am passionate about building intelligent agents that can understand and interact with the physical world through natural language. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or have any questions!
